### Summary of Today's Work

1. **Tracking Task Duration**: Implemented functionality to mark tasks as pending and track the time spent on each task. The CLI now shows the time taken to complete tasks.
2. **Enhanced Task Display**: Improved the display of tasks with color coding:
   - <span style="color: red;">Red</span> for incomplete tasks
   - <span style="color: yellow;">Yellow</span> for tasks in progress
   - <span style="color: green;">Green</span> for completed tasks with time spent displayed
3. **Repository Update**: The project repository was updated with the latest code, ensuring all new features are documented and available.
4. **Library Usage**: Utilized the `colorama` library to add color coding to the task statuses.

Today's focus was on enhancing the CLI application's functionality and ensuring that the time tracking feature works as intended. Looking forward to continuing this progress and adding more features.
